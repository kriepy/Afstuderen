Week 6:

What I did until know:

* I implemented LDA.

* I build the data from the input:
For now I ignore sensors that are on for a long while and later go off ('over' is the variable that can be used to put it in)
'last' is the variable that stores the previous values from the day before.
Building the data is made varible so that the length of the time slices can be adjusted.

# Week 3:
* The length of a sensordata can be an indication for a different activity. But this is quiet hard to distinguish as how I see it from the PhD thesis.

* Seperating activities in one room are hard. Kitchen and Bathroom are here the most challenging.

* Assume you give for each day one big vector. Where every element is a timeslot. In every timeslot you can enter a value 1..n where n is the amount of sensors in the home. For every timeslot you will take the sensor which is used longest. (I still think that will make no sense, because an open door will be in a lot of times slots.) Maybe bigger timeslots will do the trick to find long activities, like sleeping, being away.



STEPs to be done:

1. Descritze the data: 
So every day needs to be split in slices of 30 minutes. All sensors are devided in sections. The sections are S(leeping), B(athroom), L(iving), K(itchen) and D(oor). In every timeslice we will count the amount of times a sensor in certain section is triggered.
Problem occured when sometime a sensor fires a 0 while there hasn't been fired a 1.

2. Building 'Words' from the descretized data:
A word will be the previous, now and next timeslice values. And also the time of a day is taken into account (Course Grain). So a word for a timeslice will be a vector of length 16 (5,5,5,1).
Every day is stored in a matrix of size 48x16. Where every row will represent a word.

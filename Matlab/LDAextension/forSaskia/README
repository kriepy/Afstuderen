Every data file contains 4 variables
a:= a vector of length k=20 (amount of topics). A higher value gives
        an indiaction that the topic is more important. Topics with values
        close to zero should be ignored.
b:= is a 6 x k-matrix. Every entry contains two fields:
        beta.mu:= is the mean of the dimension given a topic. The six 
                  dimensions are 
                  {Bathroom, Kitchen, Bedroom, Living, Hallway, Time}
        beta.sigma:= contains the standard deviation for each dimension
l:= is the likelihood (probably of no use) Only an indication of how likeli
    the data is
d.data:= contains the sensor counts per dimension for every timeslice
d.date:= the date of the day
d.phi:=  The probablities of how much a timeslice belongs to one topic.
         (This is the fun part :) I assign the topic with the highest 
         probability to a timeslice.

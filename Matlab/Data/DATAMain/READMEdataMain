plotFields:
Contains the data of all 5 houses. The data is seperated into the 5 fields.
There needs to come a function which can visualize this data.
The structure of this variable is
House{i}.HouseNr        = INT
        .Fields{j}      = STRING
        .day{j}.date    = STRING
               .plo{k}  = matrix 2-by-len (1st row is time, 2nd row 0/1)
where k represent the 5 fields


plotSensors:
Contains the plot data for every sensor seperated.
House
House{i}.HouseNr        = INT
        .Fields{j}      = STRING
        .day{j}.date    = STRING
               .plo{k}  = matrix 2-by-len (1st row is time, 2nd row 0/1)
where k represent k sensors

sepDays:
Contains for every day a matrix of size 8 by N where N is variable with respect
to the amount of sensor activities fired. The columms are:
year, month, day, hour, minute, second, sensorNr, value(0/1)
House{i}.HouseNr            = INT
        .day{j}.data        = STRING
               .data        = matrix m-by-8, where is the amount of triggers on a day
        .Sensors{p}.nr      = INT     (Sensor number)
                   .field   = STRING  (field of the sensor)
                   .type    = STRING  (type of the sensor)
                   .name    = STRING  (name of the sensor)

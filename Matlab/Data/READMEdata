DataPlain:
Here the data is stored for all five houses. This is the plain we get from the sensors

DataMain:
Here we store all data so that we can use them in next steps
The data is split into days, every day starts at 3 am.
We do not take the timeslice of the previous day into account,
because this would take to much trouble with transition calculation
you have to draw the line somewhere. And nights are not that hard to find topics.

AlgMain:
Here all algorithms are stored that calculated the mainDate. We assume that these
algs only have to be used once, but in case that it needs to be looked in again
the scripts in this folder contains the information how these algs are run.

ALGClusteren:
Creates the clustered data and stores it in the DATAClustered file.

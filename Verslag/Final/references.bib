In this chapter we present the state of the art probabilistic models used in activity recognition and show their performance on several real world datasets. Our results can be used as a baseline for comparing the performance of other pattern recognition methods (both probabilistic and non-probabilistic). The datasets used in this chapter are made public, together with the source code of the probabilistic models used.}},

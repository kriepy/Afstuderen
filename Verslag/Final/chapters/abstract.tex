In this thesis two novel variations of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model are presented. The models give the opportunity to detect patterns in low-dimensional sensor data in an unsupervised manner. LDA-Gaussian is a combination of a Gaussian Mixture Model and a LDA model. Here the multinomial distribution of the topics, that is normally used in the LDA model, is replaced by a set of Gaussian Distributions. In this way similar looking sensor data is automatically grouped together and captured in the same topic.
LDA-Poisson, the second variation of the model, takes a set of Poisson Distribution for the topic descriptions. This distribution makes it possible to handle discrete low-dimensional data. The parameters of both models are determined with an EM-algorithm.
Both models are applied to real sensor data, which is gathered in the homes of elderly people. It is shown that meaningful topics can be found and that a semantic description of these topics can be given.
